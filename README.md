## Compiling
### Prerequisites
Microsoft Visual Studio (Preferably the latest version) with C++ installed.

### Compiling from the source
Open the solution file `McAccountChecker.sln`, then select `Release | x64` on the Build configuration and press Build solution.

You need curl and raidjosn to Compile this! I recommend using it to install the required dependencies.

## Errors
### vcruntime140.dll and msvcp140.dll errors
That happens because you don't have the runtime and libraries required for this to run.  
Please install preferably both `x86` and `x64` packages of the VC++ 2019 runtime linked below.
