# Fast Minecraft Name Checker with Proxies

## Overview

This is a high-speed Minecraft name checker written in C++ that leverages proxies to efficiently verify the availability of Minecraft usernames. The program is designed to rapidly check a list of usernames against the Minecraft server, and the use of proxies allows for increased speed and reduced risk of IP blocking.

## Features

- **Speed**: The program is optimized for performance and can check a large number of usernames in a short period.
- **Proxy Support**: Proxies are used to distribute requests and prevent IP-based rate limiting.
- **Configurable**: The program is highly configurable, allowing you to set the number of threads, proxy list, and input username file.

## Requirements

- Proxy list file formatted as one proxy per line (We have a proxys scaper built in so dont worry)
- Input username list file (formatted as one username per line)

## How to use
- download and run the .exe(https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/McNameChecker/releases/tag/1.0)
## Important Notes

- Ensure that you have the legal right to check the availability of Minecraft usernames. Respect Minecraft's terms of service and avoid using this tool for any malicious purposes.
- Using proxies can help prevent IP blocking, but it does not guarantee anonymity. Exercise caution and use reputable proxies to avoid potential security risks.
- The speed of the name checking process depends on your internet connection and the quality of the proxies used.
